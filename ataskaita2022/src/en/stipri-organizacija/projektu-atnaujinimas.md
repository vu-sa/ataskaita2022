## Development of VU SR Strategic Plan 2022-2025

This year, VU SR\'s Strategic Action Plan for the period 2019-2022
expires. For this reason, we reviewed and prepared an updated draft of
strategic action plan for 2022-2025 in the organization. Different units
of the organization and their members were involved in the process, and
the draft of the new strategic action plan created by designing possible
visions for the future, was submitted to the VU SR Parliament.

## Culture of self-reflection

This year, new processes have been created in the organization, and one
of them is the introduction of self-reflection culture. In order to
improve in one\'s field and to see if the goals set have already been
achieved (or perhaps are still being pursued), it is necessary to
reflect. It is during self-reflections that the opportunity is given not
only to evaluate yourself and your development process, but also to help
yourself to move on. The above-mentioned tool is divided into two parts:
questions are designed to evaluate yourself every few months in the
organization and everyday questions that allow you to reflect on the
activities of the day and provide an opportunity to improve on a daily
basis.

## The path of the member

In recent years, the membership path of the organization has been
reviewed, and this year a concept was adopted based on more effective
member engagement, the equal inclusion of curators, student
representatives, programs, clubs, projects and long-term members in the
ongoing processes on the basis of a culture of self-reflection. The aim
of this concept is to pay more attention to the individual empowerment
and involvement of each member in the organized activities. For each
group of members (first members, curators, representatives of the SPC,
long-term members) a specific concept of the membership path has been
developed, taking into account the specifics of their work, the level of
experience and competences.
