- To approve the updated VU SR training organization application
  template;
- In each VU SR U, have a person responsible for monitoring exams,
  thus ensuring high-quality activities of the VU SR program
  \"Sąžiningai\";
- Setting up a working group to update the \"Chairperson\'s Guide\" in
  order to facilitate the transfer of experience to new heads of
  departments;
- Implement the renewal of the VU SR DPG (Data Protection Group)
  process;
- To organize the 2022 reporting-election conferences by contact;
- To direct the centralized marketing process of VU SR, in which VU SA
  U marketing coordinators (if any) and volunteers collected by VU SR
  marketing coordinator operate from 1st of July 2022;
- To validate the concept of membership of the organization, which is
  based on more effective employee engagement, the equal involvement
  of curators, student representatives, programs, clubs, projects and
  long-term members in the ongoing processes on the basis of a culture
  of self-reflection;
- To update the membership system, expand the member\'s test with
  knowledge about the VU structures, the services provided by the
  University, the VU SA strategy, the organisation\'s structure and
  image. It was decided to develop an e-learning course alongside the
  test, which will help to ensure deeper development of competences in
  each topic.
