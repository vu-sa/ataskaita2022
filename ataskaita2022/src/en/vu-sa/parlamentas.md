:::

The Parliament of VU SR, confirming the main preconditions for the
integration process and submitting proposals for the improvement of this
process, adopted a resolution on the integration of foreign students at
the University.

Realizing the importance of integration, which is
evident when foreign students try to integrate into the social and
academic life of the University, the Parliament of VU SR tries in this
letter to draw attention to the dissemination of information in the
University\'s communication channels and physical spaces – it
encourages to spread the message not only in Lithuanian, but also in
English, and thus to provide all the necessary information to foreign
students(s).

The letter also emphasizes the topic of foreign language
competences of the University\'s staff, accountability and inclusiveness
of university formations, creation of additional activities in a foreign
language for all members of the community (proposals on how to implement
all this were also submitted).

:::

In order to draw the attention of the State of Lithuania to the legal
situation of foreign students in Lithuania and their growing number, the
Parliament of VU SR emphasizes that the legal status of foreign and
Lithuanian students must be equivalent, thus creating suitable

academic development and relief of financial burdens.

national level.

The main proposals are focused on compensating for the
